turnin code:  sdd_p1

Write a D program that finds all hypothetical (putative) genes
in fasta file provided as the first command-line argument.
The file will contain one or more contigs in fasta format.
If there is a  #  in column 1, ignore the line.

Treat atg as the only start codon.
The only stop codons to search for are:  taa, tag, tga
Two or more genes may end at the same stop codon which implies that a long
gene may contain a shorter gene which begins in the same reading frame.
A gene may occur fully within another gene if the start and stops are in
different reading frames.  Likewise, one gene may overlap another, but
this implies they are in different reading frames, else they would have
to share the stop codon.

Only retrieve genes that are between 99 and 1500 characters inclusive.

Also, be sure to retrieve genes on both the plus and minus strands.
This implies that the minus strand must be complemented.

Produce as output loc information like that in our samples, e.g.:
    kb|g.3077.c.0_545954+213
    
Use turnin to submit a single D "script" which has the magic first line:
    #!/usr/bin/rdmd
