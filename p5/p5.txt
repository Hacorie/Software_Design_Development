turnin code:  sdd_p5

Write a D program that reads a pair of strings from a filename
specified on the cmd-line, i.e. NOT from stdin.  Each string will be
on a single line by itself.  Be sure to strip off whitespace at each
end of the strings, including newlines.  The program should align the
pair of strings.  Use the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm as discussed in
class (off the Software Design web page).  When there are choices
in the traceback step, choose diagonal, then left, and finally up.
Note there is a special case in which you may get to the leftmost
column before top row in which you merely keep the remaining chars
from the top string matched with '-'; similarly for getting to top
row before left column.

Run the program as follows:
    pgmname  filename  match_value  mismatch_penalty  gap_penalty
For example:
    ./p5.d  file_of_string_pairs  +5  -4  -8

As output, you should print the alignment and a blank line.  Do not
clear the screen.  The output should be placed on stdout.  The input
may contain comment lines at arbitrary points in the file; they should
be skipped.
The first line with a string should be the one "across" the top of
the matrix.

Sample input:
    # this is a comment (a # in column 1 designates a comment)
    ACGT
    ACT

Sample output for the above input:
    ACGT
    AC-T

Use turnin to submit JUST your script, NOT a tar file.
