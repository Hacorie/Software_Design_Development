turnin code:  sdd_p2

Write a D program that computes the protein sequences from all protein
encoding genes (pegs) listed in a file named as the first command-line
argument.  The file will have the same format as our 8_* file and the
pegs will be listed as locs in the third field, e.g.:
    kb|g.3077.c.0_545954+213 
    kb|g.3077.c.0_347271-684
The contigs will be in a file named as the second command-line argument.

Produce fasta format using the peg id (second field in first file) as the
ID of the sequence:
    >kb|g.3077.peg.1
    MAAAAAA....

Write the output to stdout so that it can be redirected.
    
Use turnin to submit a single D "script" which has the magic first line:
    #!/usr/bin/rdmd
