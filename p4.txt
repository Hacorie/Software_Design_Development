turnin code:  sdd_p4

Turnin a tar file containing a directory containing a shell script
named p4.sh which executes your entire pipeline of p1, p2, p3, and a
new p4.d program.  You can alter the old programs in any way you choose.
The script will take 2 command line args:
    - a file containing the contigs for one known genome 
    - a db file containing all known data
p4.d should take the output from the prior programs and check validity
of the annotations against the known data.
The tar file should contain all programs and scripts, but no data or
small data files for quick testing.
The database of known data will be our 8_* file.
Be sure to print information about false positives as well as 
called annotations.
